Browser Back/Forward

Design how you could design a browser back/forward system using two stacks,
so that you can visit a series of sites (Google, Yahoo, EBay, go back to
Yahoo, then forward again to EBay, then onto Apple, and so on).

Write pseudo-code for this.


Two stacks:  Backward and Forward

When both are empty, the first site visited gets added to Backwards
Each subsequent visit to a new site gets added to Backwards.
When "Back" is clicked in the browser, pop() is called on the Backward stack
and the returned value is pushed to the Forward stack.
When "Forward" is clicked in the browser, pop() is called on the Forward stack
and the returned value is pushed to the Backward stack.
